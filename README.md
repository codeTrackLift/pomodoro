## About
This was developed during Bootcamp Week 9, our 'Intro to React' week.  There were some struggles due to the lesson materials being in React 17 as opposed to React 18.  

To validated my understanding, I decided to make and deploy this React App.

## How to Run
>Break & Session Time

Adjust using up and down arrow buttons, default is 5 min Break & 25 min Session.

>Start / Stop / Reset

These buttons operate as expected.

## Future Roadmap
This is a progression project, no further development is anticipated.
